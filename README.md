Maisey Misadventure progress:
I started by just going with my gut. Using a previously made flow chart I just jumped into it.
It all went swimmingly untill I tried to input a character class. In doing so, I messed everything up. Like, everything.
I deleted everything and tried again. I had to do some serious stretching of what the class would be used for but I eventually managed to have both a character class and working code.
Now the user can customize the chicken they go against!
As a final add on, i implimented some custom ASCII art from real refrences of Maisey, the main character
Now  its finished!

| | | | | | |---> The chickens smell your fear. They decide to be good Samaritans and leave you be. You run back inside. (activity_choice)
| | | | | |
| | | | | |---> Show them who's boss!
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |---> Uh oh. Bad idea. The chickens aren't afraid, they are never afraid. They take up your challenge and chase you. They chase and peck at you all day.
